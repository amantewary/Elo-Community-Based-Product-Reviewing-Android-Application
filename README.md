## Installation Notes

1. Download the code from the GitHub account "Svenvollfied25/Project_Elo".
2. Open the downloaded code in the Android studio. 
3. Create a new SHA-1 key using the terminal. The command is "keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore" for mac. It prompts for the password, which is "android" for mac.
4. Copy the newly created SHA-1 on the firebase account "Elo - Gadget Review App".(We would provide the Gmail account in the final zip folder)
5. Run the app.
6 In any case above step does not work. We would be sharing signed apk file of our app.





## Code Examples

Currently, the user credentials and activities are not being stored and tracked in the database when the user opts for the  Gmail login due to time constraints. These changes are will be incorporated in the future.

**Problem 1: Method for handling the user signin**

A short description.
```
googleSignIn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View view) {
        Intent signInIntent = mGoogleSignInClient.getSignInIntent();
        startActivityForResult(signInIntent, RC_SIGN_IN);
    }
});

private void handleSignInResult(Task<GoogleSignInAccount> completedTask) {
        try {
            GoogleSignInAccount account = completedTask.getResult(ApiException.class);

            // Signed in successfully, show authenticated UI.
            Intent intent = new Intent(LoginActivity.this, HomeActivity.class);
            startActivity(intent);
            finish();
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            // The ApiException status code indicates the detailed failure reason.
            // Please refer to the GoogleSignInStatusCodes class reference for more information.
            Log.e(LoginActivity.class.getCanonicalName(), "signInResult:failed code=" + e.getStatusCode());
//            updateUI(null);
        }
